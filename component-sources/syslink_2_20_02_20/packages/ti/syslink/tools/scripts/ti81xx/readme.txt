These scripts are used to exercise the entire set of cores for the TI814X and 
TI816X.  Typically, the VPSS and VIDEO cores run specialized code thus SysLink 
samples may not be applicable. These scripts are provided for full coverage
when needed. 

Refer to the scripts in the 'ti81xx/ezsdk' directory for typical SysLink 
application scripts on the TI814X and TI816X devices.
